Upton
==========
Upton is a framework for easy web-scraping with a useful debug mode that doesn't hammer your target's servers. It does the repetitive parts of writing scrapers, so you only have to write the unique parts for each site.

Documentation
----------------------

With Upton, you can scrape complex sites in just one line of code.

    Upton::Scraper.new("http://www.whatever.com", "section#links a", :css).scrape do |article_str|
      #do stuff.
    end

Just specify a URL to a list of links, an XPath or CSS selector for the links and a block of what to do with the content of the pages you've scraped.

Upton operates on the theory that, for most scraping projects, you need to scrape two types of pages:

1. Index pages, which list instance pages. For example, a job search site's search page or a newspaper's homepage.
2. Instance pages, which represent the goal of your scraping, e.g. job listings or news articles.

For more complex use cases, subclass `Upton::Scraper` and override the relevant methods. If you're scraping links from an API, you would override `get_index`; if you needed to set a cookie or log in before scraping a site, you would override `get_instance`.

The `get_instance` and `get_index` methods use a protected method `get_page(url)` which, well, gets a page. That's not very special. The more interesting part is that `get_page(url, stash)` transparently stashes the response of each request if the second parameter, `stash`, is true. Whenever you repeat a request (with `true` as the second parameter), the stashed HTML is returned without going to the server. This is helpful in the development stages of a project when you're testing some aspect of the code and don't want to hit a server each time. If you are using `get_instance` and `get_index`, this can be en/disabled per instance of `Upton::Scraper` or its subclasses with the `@debug` option. Setting the `stash` parameter of the `get_page` method should only be used if you've overridden `get_instance` or `get_index` in a subclass.

Upton also sleeps (by default) 30 seconds between non-stashed requests, to reduce load on the server you're scraping. This is configurable with the `@nice_sleep_time` option.

**Important Note:** Upton is alpha software. The API may change at any time. 

Example
----------------------
If you want to scrape ProPublica's website with Upton, this is how you'd do it. (Scraping our [RSS feed](http://feeds.propublica.org/propublica/main) would be smarter, but not every site has a full-text RSS feed...)

      Upton::Scraper.new("http://www.propublica.org", "section#river section h1 a", :css).scrape do |article_string|
        puts "here is the full text of the ProPublica article: \n #{article_string}"
        #or, do other stuff here.
      end


Why "Upton"
----------------------
Upton Sinclair was a pioneering, muckraking journalist who is most famous for _The Jungle_, a novel portraying the reality of immigrant labor struggles in Chicago meatpacking plants at the start of the 1900s. Upton, the gem, sprang out of a ProPublica project pertaining to labor issues.
