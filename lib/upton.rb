# **Upton** is a framework for easy web-scraping with a useful debug mode 
# that doesn't hammer your target's servers. It does the repetitive parts of 
# writing scrapers, so you only have to write the unique parts for each site.
#
# Upton operates on the theory that, for most scraping projects, you need to
# scrape two types of pages:
# 
# 1. Index pages, which list instance pages. For example, a job search 
#     site's search page or a newspaper's homepage.
# 2. Instance pages, which represent the goal of your scraping, e.g.
#     job listings or news articles.

module Upton

  # Upton::Scraper is implemented as an abstract class. Implement a class to
  # inherit from Upton::Scraper. 
  class AbstractMethodError < Exception; end
  class Scraper
    # ## Basic use-case methods.

    # This is the main user-facing method for a basic scraper.
    # Call `scrape` with a block; this block will be called on 
    # the text of each instance page, (and optionally, its URL and its index
    # in the list of instance URLs returned by `get_index`).
    def scrape &blk
      self.scrape_from_list(self.get_index, blk)
    end

    # Return a list of URLs for the instances you want to scrape.
    #
    # You probably want to use Nokogiri or another HTML parser to find the
    # links to the instances within the HTML of the index page; alternatively,
    # you might make a call to a search API in this method.
    #
    # This is an abstract method; you *must* override it in your subclass.
    def get_index
      raise AbstractMethodError
    end

    # ## Configuration Variables
    def initialize

      # If true, then Upton prints information about when it gets
      # files from the internet and when it gets them from its stash.
      @verbose = false

      # If true, then Upton fetches each page only once
      # future requests for that file are responded to with the locally stashed
      # version.
      # You may want to set @debug to false for production (but maybe not).
      # You can also control stashing behavior on a per-call basis with the
      # optional second argument to get_page, if, for instance, you want to 
      # stash instance pages, but not index pages.
      @debug = true

      # In order to not hammer servers, Upton waits for, by default, 30  
      # seconds between requests to the remote server.
      @nice_sleep_time = 30 #seconds

      # Folder name for stashes, if you want them to be stored somewhere else,
      # e.g. under /tmp.
      @stash_folder = "stashes"
      
    end



    # ## Advanced use-case methods.

    # If instance pages (not index pages) are paginated, **you must override**
    # this method to return the next URL, given the current URL and its index.
    #
    # If instance pages aren't paginated, there's no need to override this.
    #
    # Return URLs that are empty strings are ignored (and recursion stops.)
    # e.g. next_instance_page_url("http://whatever.com/article/upton-sinclairs-the-jungle?page=1", 2)
    # ought to return "http://whatever.com/article/upton-sinclairs-the-jungle?page=2"
